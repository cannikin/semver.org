Work in progress: https://semver.netlify.com/

Translations are kept in the `/specs` directory.

`yarn spec_to_html` will convert the Markdown specs into styled HTML pages.

`yarn build` will run `spec_to_html` as well as generate styles and remaining static pages.

Deploying to Netlify will rebuild all spec pages.
